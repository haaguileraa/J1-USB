WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   per_d/d_16/ctl_dv/state[2]_PWR_19_o_Mux_22_o is sourced by a combinatorial
   pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading
   of data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <cpu0/Mram_dstack1_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <cpu0/Mram_dstack2_RAMD_D1_O> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.
